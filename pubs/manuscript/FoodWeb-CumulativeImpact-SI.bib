  abstract = {Motivation The availability of user-friendly, high-resolution global environmental datasets is crucial for bioclimatic modelling. For terrestrial environments, WorldClim has served this purpose since 2005, but equivalent marine data only became available in 2012, with pioneer initiatives like Bio-ORACLE providing data layers for several ecologically relevant variables. Currently, the available marine data packages have not yet been updated to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predictions nor to present times, and are mostly restricted to the top surface layer of the oceans, precluding the modelling of a large fraction of the benthic diversity that inhabits deeper habitats. To address this gap, we present a significant update of Bio-ORACLE for new future climate scenarios, present-day conditions and benthic layers (near sea bottom). The reliability of data layers was assessed using a cross-validation framework against in situ quality-controlled data. This test showed a generally good agreement between our data layers and the global climatic patterns. We also provide a package of functions in the R software environment (sdmpredictors) to facilitate listing, extraction and management of data layers and allow easy integration with the available pipelines for bioclimatic modelling. Main types of variable contained Surface and benthic layers for water temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll, sea ice, current velocity, phytoplankton, primary productivity, iron and light at bottom. Spatial location and grain Global at 5 arcmin (c. 0.08\textdegree{} or 9.2 km at the equator). Time period and grain Present (2000\textendash 2014) and future (2040\textendash 2050 and 2090\textendash 2100) environmental conditions based on monthly averages. Major taxa and level of measurement Marine biodiversity associated with sea surface and epibenthic habitats. Software format ASCII and TIFF grid formats for geographical information systems and a package of functions developed for R software.},

  abstract = {The St. Lawrence is a vast and complex socio-ecological system providing a wealth of services sustaining numerous economic sectors. These ecosystems are subject to significant human pressures that overlap and potentially interact with climate driven environmental changes. Our objective in this paper is to systematically characterize the distribution and intensity of drivers in the St. Lawrence System. To do so, we launch eDrivers, an open knowledge platform gathering experts committed to structuring, standardizing and sharing knowledge on drivers in support of science and management. We gathered data on 22 coastal, climate, fisheries and marine traffic drivers through collaborations, existing environmental initiatives and open data portals. We show that few areas of the St. Lawrence are free of cumulative exposure. The Estuary, the Anticosti Gyre and coastal areas are particularly exposed, especially in the vicinity of urban centers. We identified 6 areas of distinct cumulative exposure regime that show that certain drivers typically co-occur in different regions of the St. Lawrence and that coastal areas are exposed to all driver types. Of particular concern are two threat complexes capturing most exposure hotspots that show the convergence of contrasting exposure regimes at the head of the Laurentian Channel. eDrivers was built on a series of guiding principles upholding existing data management and open science standards. We therefore expect it to evolve through time to address knowledge gaps and refine current driver layers. Ultimately, we believe that eDrivers represents a much needed solution that could radically influence broad scale research and management practices by increasing knowledge accessibility and interoperability.},

  abstract = {An overview of chemical and biological oceanographic conditions in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) in 2016 is presented as part of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP). AZMP data as well as data from regional monitoring programs are analyzed and presented in relation to long-term means in the context of a strong warming event that began in 2010. Nitrate inventories in 2016 were mostly below normal in the 0\textendash 50 m layer, due to a mild early winter, but strongly above normal in the deeper layer (particularly in the southern and eastern GSL). According to satellite imagery, phytoplankton biomass averaged annually (March\textendash November) over the GSL was slightly below the long-term average. A dominance of small cells (flagellates and dinoflagellates) within phytoplankton assemblages, as observed at Shediac Valley station, could explain why annual biomass was generally low. Nevertheless, spring bloom magnitude and amplitude were generally higher than the climatology (1999\textendash 2010). Spring bloom maximum biomass even reached a record high in the western GSL. Positive diatom anomalies at Rimouski station were responsible for the strong biomass found there all year-round (April\textendash October), and high diatom abundance could also explain the strong phytoplankton biomass retrieved elsewhere in western GSL during spring. The spring bloom occurred earlier and lasted longer than normal in the Magdalen Shallows and Cabot Strait, while timing was normal and duration was shorter in the northern GSL. Zooplankton biomass in 2016 was among the lowest recorded so far throughout the GSL, mainly due to the decreased abundance of Calanus finmarchicus, which showed the earliest stage development observed so far at Rimouski station. The large calanoid index was above normal for the first time since 2006 in the western GSL due to a high abundance of C. hyperboreus. The positive anomalies observed since 2008 for the abundances of small calanoids, cyclopoids, warm-water-associated copepods, Pseudocalanus spp., and non-copepod species continued in 2016. They were possibly due to a combination of warm water and reduced competition since abundances of Calanus spp. were generally low.},

AZMP data as well as data from regional monitoring programs are analysed and presented in relation to long-term means. The annual average freshwater runoff of the St. Lawrence River measured at Qu\'ebec City and its combination with rivers flowing into the Estuary (RIVSUM II) were both at the highest level since 1974. Above-normal January air temperatures led to late onset of sea-ice and the sixth lowest sea ice cover maximum volume since 1969, but the winter mixed layer volume was nearnormal. The August cold intermediate layer (CIL) showed warmer than normal minimum temperature (+0.8 SD) and less than normal volume of water colder than 1\textdegree C (-0.6 SD), but the seasonally average minimum temperature index was near normal. Sea-surface temperatures averaged over the Gulf were near normal or above normal from May to November 2017, leading to an above-normal May-November average (+0.6\textdegree C, +0.9 SD). The timing of summer warming onset and fall cooling were respectively slightly sooner (-0.7 weeks) and later than normal (+1.7 weeks). Deep water temperatures have been increasing overall in the Gulf, with inward advection from Cabot Strait. Gulf average temperature decreased from 2015 record highs at 150 and 200 m, remaining above-normal (2.7\textdegree C, +0.5 SD and 5.0\textdegree C, +1.4 SD), decreased slightly at 250 m (6.0\textdegree C, +2.7 SD) from the 2016 record high but increased to a new record level at 300 m (6.3\textdegree C, +5.0 SD). The bottom area covered by waters warmer than 6\textdegree C decreased in 2017 in Anticosti Channel and Esquiman Channel, but increased sharply in Central Gulf and made its first appearance in the northwest Gulf.},
