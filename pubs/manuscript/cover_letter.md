Dear Editors,

We are submitting this cover letter in the hope that you will consider reviewing our manuscript entitled *"Interactions amplify cumulative effects in marine ecosystems"* for publication in Nature. 

Evaluating the effects of stressors on biodiversity is becoming increasingly vital as global changes expand worldwide, yet our understanding of the effects of multiple stressors remains minimal after decades of research. In this manuscript, we are proposing a novel approach to assess cumulative effects that explicitly considers the indirect affects arising from species interactions. We are applying this method by assessing the cumulative effects of 18 environmental stressors on 193 taxa of the St. Lawrence marine System in eastern Canada between 2010 and 2015. For many species of the St. Lawrence System, our approach identifies previously unknown threats and finds that risks associated with effects propagating through species interactions often outweigh risks from direct effects. Most commercially exploited species and species at risk in the St. Lawrence fall in that category, suggesting that current management plans and recovery strategies may ignore significant threats by overlooking indirect effects. 

Our work builds on a seminal paper published by Benjamin Halpern in 2008 (Science 319:948-952 doi: 10.1126/science.114934) that assessed the cumulative effects of global changes on marine ecosystems worldwide. At the time we are writing this letter, their assessment has been cited 7000 times and at least 500 times per year for the past 10 years. Their assessment has also been updated in 2015 (Nat. Commun. 6:7615 doi: 10.1038/ncomms8615) and in 2019 (Sci Rep 9:11609 doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-47201-9), combining for an additional 1700 citations. They also applied their method to other ecosystem components such as marine predators (Maxwell et al. 2013 Nat. Commun. 4:2688 doi: 10.1038/ncomms3688, 310 citations) and species at risk (O'Hara et al. 2021, Science 372:84-87 doi: 10.1126/science.abe673, 97 citations). In Canada, the federal government has been heavily vested in using this method to assess cumulative effects on its marine ecosystems, which has led to cumulative effects assessments on habitats of the Pacific Ocean (Clarke-Murray et al. ) and of the Scotian Shelf (Kelly et al, *in prep*). 

However, the approach developed by Halpern considers that the ecosystem components on which the assessment is performed (*e.g.* habitats, species) are independent. Recent publications discuss the importance of food web structure and species interactions for cumulative effects research, especially for the management of commercially exploited species and species at risk (*e.g.* De Laender 2018, Global Change Biology; Bruder et al. 2019, Frontiers Environ. Science; Hodgson et al. 2019, Frontiers Ecol Evol; Orr et al. 2020, Proceeding Royal Soc). To address this gap, we recently explored the role of species interactions in mediating the effects of stressors (Beauchesne et al. 2021, Ecol. Let. 24:2219-2237 doi: 10.1111/ele.13841; 24 citations). This work showed that considering the intricacies of ecological communities is key to properly assess the effects of stressors on species and laid the foundations of a framework to identify the most sensitive species in food webs exposed to multiple stressors. In our manuscript, we merge this recent research effort with Halpern's methodology to explicitly consider indirect effects arising from species interactions; this major technical contribution sheds new lights on the anthropogenic threats affecting a vast marine ecosystem. 

Although this work has yet to be published, it has led to an assessment of cumulative effects on food webs of the Scotian Shelf in the Atlantic Ocean (https://ecosystem-assessments.github.io/nceadfo/). Discussions are also ongoing to apply this framework more broadly in Canada's oceans as well as in the Great Lakes, and to combine it with previous assessments done on Canada's marine ecosystems. 

We hope that you will find the proposed manuscript suitable for evaluation in Nature.

Sincrerely,
